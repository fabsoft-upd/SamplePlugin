# FabSoft Universal Printer Driver - API Sample / Template
The FabSoft Universal Printer Driver (UPD) allows plugins to control how documents are delivered. As there are various requirements for different destination, this sample only provides a template and overview of the capabilities. For working samples that implement the API, see the "Working Samples" section below.

**This sample demonstrates:**

* Creating the properties available in the workflow.
* Creating a custom filter to clean data.
* Submitting the printed document to a back-end web service.
* Refreshing the status (For scenarios where the status is not available at the time of submission).
